# Ecosystem Game

This is a proof of concept for a game using the Madingley model developed by UN-WCMC - a
complex, general ecosystem model that models interactions between terrestrial and aquatic
lifeforms.

The game is intended to raise awareness about the impacts of human decisions on
the environment and how ecosystems can change due to habitat loss, overexploitation,
climate change and many other human influenced factors.

The game does not currently interface with the Madingley model, but instead a simplified
ecosystem model that just simulates carnivore and herbivore populations, and the effects
of human hunting ("harvesting") on them.

## Installation and running

See `backend/README.md` and `frontend/README.md` for instructions. Both backend and frontend need
to be running for the game to work.
